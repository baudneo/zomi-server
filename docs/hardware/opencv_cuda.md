# Build OpenCV with CUDA support
Build opencv with CUDA and cuDNN support using an available tutorial on the web.

[Here is one](https://gist.github.com/baudneo/6d781e9b7a7cc4afe0d4b23d6e772ee0)

# Link OpenCV CUDA into `zomi-server` virtual environment
You must then link in the CUDA/cuDNN opencv libs into the venv to use GPU acceleration in opencv.
## Not Implemented
This tutorial will be written at a later date.
